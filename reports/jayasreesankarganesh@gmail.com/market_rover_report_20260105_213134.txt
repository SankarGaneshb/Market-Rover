**Master Intelligence Report**

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Executive Summary:**

Global markets exhibit mixed signals. Rising crude oil prices pose a significant headwind for specific sectors (Aviation, Paints, Tyres), while positive momentum in global indices (NASDAQ, S&P 500) supports the IT sector. A strengthening USD/INR benefits Indian exporters. Portfolio analysis reveals downtrends in several key stocks (TCS, HDFC Bank, Infosys), requiring careful monitoring. RELIANCE.NS shows potential signs of institutional accumulation, while ICICIBANK.NS demonstrates bullish momentum. Price squeezes across multiple stocks indicate potential for increased volatility.

**1. Global Cues & Macro Headwinds:**
