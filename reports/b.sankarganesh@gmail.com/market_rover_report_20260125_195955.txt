**Master Intelligence Report**

**Executive Summary:**

Global cues are positive, with rising crude oil and gold prices, and positive movement in NASDAQ and S&P 500. However, the elevated USD/INR (91.56) requires monitoring. Market sentiment is generally positive, aligning with the GROWTH regime. The potential reduction in EU car import tariffs presents both opportunities and risks, particularly for M&M. Technical analysis suggests a defensive approach (buy at support), despite the growth regime. Forensic analysis identifies potential accumulation zones and bull traps that require further investigation.
