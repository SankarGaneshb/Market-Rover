  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Monitor Crude Oil Prices: Closely track crude oil movements and their potential impact on Reliance Industries.",
    "Check Corporate Actions: Fetch corporate actions for RELIANCE.NS and TCS.NS to identify any upcoming events.",
    "Scrape Stock-Specific News: Gather the latest news for all portfolio stocks to identify any company-specific developments.",

  "overallMarketSentiment": {
    "sentiment": "Neutral to Slightly Positive",
    "rationale": "Market experts are optimistic about the 'India growth story,' but FIIs are net sellers, indicating some caution. The pause in inflows into the Nifty Microcap 250 index fund suggests concerns about valuations in a specific market segment. Global cues are mixed (positive US market, rising crude oil).",
    "extremeSentiment": "No",
    "justification": "While there are positive and negative factors influencing individual stocks and the overall market, none of the indicators point to widespread panic or euphoria. The report suggests a cautious optimism, with a need for monitoring key factors like crude oil prices and corporate actions. The divergence between FII and DII investment strategies further suggests a lack of uniform sentiment."
