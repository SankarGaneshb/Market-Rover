# 🛠️ Market-Rover Operational Manual

This guide covers how to handle operational issues that require manual intervention. The system is designed to heal itself from minor glitches (retries), but some issues demand a human touch.

## 🚨 Troubleshooting & Manual Fixes

### 1. LLM Failures (CrewExecutionError)
**Status**: Partially Automated (3 Retries)
**Symptom**: "Invalid response from LLM call" or "ValueError" in logs.
**Action**:
1.  **Check Logs**: Go to `logs/market_rover.log`.
2.  **Verify Quota**: Ensure your Gemini API key hasn't hit its rate limit or monthly quota.
3.  **Manual Restart**: If retries fail 3 times, the API might be down or blocked.
    *   Wait 15 minutes.
    *   Restart the server: `python app.py` (or restart the Docker container).

### 2. Dependency Issues (ImportError)
**Status**: Manual Fix Required
**Symptom**: "cannot import name 'xyz'" or "ModuleNotFoundError".
**Action**:
1.  **Rebuild Environment**: Dependencies might be out of sync.
    ```powershell
    # Windows
    deactivate
    rm -r .venv
    python -m venv .venv
    .\.venv\Scripts\Activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2.  **Check Deployment**: If on Streamlit Cloud, check `packages.txt` and `requirements.txt`.


### 3. Missing Data Files (FileNotFoundError)
**Status**: Manual Fix Required
**Symptom**: "File not found: Portfolio.csv"
**Action**:
1.  **Upload Data**: Ensure `Portfolio.csv` is present in the root directory.
2.  **Format Check**: Ensure it has columns: `Symbol`, `Qty`, `Avg Price`.

## 🛑 Limitations & Scope

Please note what is **NOT** covered by the automated retry system:

*   **Streamlit UI Crashes**: If the web page freezes or shows a big red traceback box, that is a UI error. You must refresh the page (`F5`).
*   **External CI/CD**: Errors in GitHub Actions or Docker deployment pipelines are outside this application's control. Check the GitHub "Actions" tab.
*   **Infrastructure**: If the server runs out of memory (OOM) or disk space, the application will crash. This requires system-level monitoring.

## 🧠 AI Training (Monthly Cycle)

To improve the Agent's accuracy without waiting for organic user activity, run this **Mental Calibration Cycle** once a month.

### Step 1: Feed the Brain (Day 1)
Run the training script to analyze Nifty 50 stocks and generate new predictions.
```powershell
python scripts/train_brain.py
```
*   **What it does**: Overwrites `Portfolio.csv` with top 20 Nifty stocks, runs the full analysis, and saves "Buy/Sell" signals to `data/memory.json`.

### Step 2: Validate Outcomes (Day 7-30)
After market movement has occurred (at least 3 days later), run the validator.
```powershell
python scripts/validate_outcomes.py
```
*   **What it does**: Checks Yahoo Finance for actual price changes. Updates the memory with "Success" or "Fail".
*   **Result**: Agents will see these outcomes in their next run and self-correct (e.g., "I failed on Banking stocks last month, I should be cautious").
```
